Branches are parallel versions of your work, within your repo.

Branches are used to keep, for example, new development out of your master branch until it is ready to be merged, or development of different things seperated.

You can create and name them as needed. There will be parent commits from before the branches forked.

Git shows conflicts between them when merging.
